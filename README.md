Bike Sharing Networks Around the World. This project started in Barcelona, when I was unable to get a decent client for the Android to work with the Bicing system. We figured out the same problem would apply for the rest of the world, thus solving it for us locally could also work globally.

Then, we also found out how important was this data for everyone, and that thereâ€™s no reason for companies to keep it private. Most of these bike sharing systems are built using public money, we believe this data should be available to their own citizens

The main reason for this project to be is for people to realize the benefits of providing free data.
